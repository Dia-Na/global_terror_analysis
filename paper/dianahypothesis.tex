\subsection{Terror Attacks in the International News}

\subsubsection{Research question/Hypothesis}
Our aim was to examine the relation between terror worldwide and the international media. It is reasonable to assume that a rise in the number of terror attacks or the number of terror victims affects the media coverage of terrorism. Therefore we expected a correlation between the number of attacks or the number of casualties (both dead and injured) and the number of articles on terror.
 
\subsubsection{Methodology}
For the analysis of international news we chose the \textit{Guardian}. The data from the \textit{Guardian} was extracted, cleaned, grouped and visualised as described in %autoref{sec:guardian_api}.
The data on terrorism was derived from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). To extract and clean the data for this hypothesis we used R.
 
\subsubsection{Results}
The analysis of the number of terror attacks worldwide per month and the number of articles per month dealing with terror showed no correlation, see figure \autoref{fig:global_attacks_guardian}.

\end{figure}

Figure \autoref{fig:wet_attacks_guardian} displays the relative number of articles per month about terror and the number of casualties caused by terror attacks per month. Again the data showed no correlation.

\end{figure}

Next, we analysed the number of casualties. Figure \autoref{fig:glob_casuaties_guardian} and figure \autoref{fig:west_casualties_guardian} show the relative number of articles per month with the keyword "terror" and the number of casualties caused by terror attacks worldwide and in western countries, respectively.
